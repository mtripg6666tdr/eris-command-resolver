# eris-command-resolver
By using this package, both `ComamndInteraction` and `Message` will be resolved as unified `CommandMessage` and you can code with `CommandMessage` with no considering the way the command passed.  
 ![this is what this package does](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56076195/187119864-66c3be2d-0c4d-4ca4-bbb5-fb049cef45ed.png)

Therefore you can support Message-based-command and Interaction-based-command at once, without any verbose codes.  

You can see more by reading [API documentation](https://mtripg6666tdr.github.io/eris-command-resolver/) or directly reading [source folder](src/).
