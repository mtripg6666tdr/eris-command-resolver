By using this package, both `ComamndInteraction` and `Message` will be resolved as unified `CommandMessage` and you can code with `CommandMessage` with no considering the way the command passed.  
 ![this is what the package does](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56076195/157648893-e409de75-4c97-423f-8095-ddeeaca2bf21.png)
Therefore you can support Message-based-command and Interaction-based-command at once, without any verbose codes.
